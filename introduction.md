# **Hackathon**

## **Introduction**
> Introduction of ourselves (Netherlands - connect to NextWAIve)
> Why floods (the topic) are relevant to us
> Introduce how global warming is related to our topic as well as natural disasters
> Goal of this dashbaord (in which we could implement CRISP-DM)

> Mention taht we're are incapable of saving humanity from global warming but, we are trying to provide insights/prevention for future catastrophic events


## **EDA**


## **Findings**



## **THEME**
Sea Level Rise  
Global warming  
Floods


## **State the problem**
As greenhouse gases trap more energy from the sun, the oceans are absorbing more heat, resulting in an increase in sea surface temperatures and rising sea level.
Is there a relationship between rising sea level and global warming? (What causes global warming? What causes sea level rising the most? How is it connected to the nature, coastal areas, underwater life? Does rising sea level represent a threat in form of flooding?

## **Problem Statement**
> How can we assess the risk of flooding per country? (how to find countries that are endangered by floods)
> *how to test accuracy of the model? (maybe by looking at the data before industrialization ()? people didn't have as advance tech as we do now to build dikes and other tools that prevent floods, therefore we can measure the flood risk more accurately.)
