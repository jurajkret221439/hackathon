collect specific data on global warming, number.

In the United States, almost 30 percent of the population lives in relatively high population-density coastal areas, where sea level plays a role in flooding, shoreline erosion, and hazards from storms. Globally, 8 of the world’s 10 largest cities are near a coast, according to the U.N. Atlas of the Oceans.

What remains true today is that populations in low-income countries – those where a large percentage of the population still live in extreme poverty, or score low on the Human Development Index – are more vulnerable to the effects of natural disasters.

What we see is that the large spikes in death rates occur almost exclusively for countries with a low or low-middle SDI. Highly developed countries are much more resilient to disaster events and therefore have a consistently low death rate from natural disasters.
