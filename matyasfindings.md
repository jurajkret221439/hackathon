As stated by (Degeai et al., 2022) Higher frequencies in flooding are significantly correlated with higher air temperature and sea surface temperatures in the northwest mediterranean. 
Taking this into account, it is safe to assume that rising air and sea surface temperatures effect regions prone to monsoons even more, causing a higher frequency of flooding.
Rising temperatures combined with an extensive array of rivers, as well as a geographically disadvantaged position in a monsoon-prone environment is a perfect recipe for high-frequency flooding.

80% of bangladesh is a floodplain (do we need data for it?)

230 something rivers (need data for it)

Add avg temperature by country (drilldown) to number of natural disasters graph? = correlation
          number of floods vs temperature change
